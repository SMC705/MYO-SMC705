LEGEND:
A- Longer registered time because phone app did'n detect "Lock" after interaction
B- Invalid time because of incorrect task (+ time for tester to notice)
C- Fake attempt (tester error)
D- MYO locks immediately (short time measured)
E- missing data for that taskID (replaced line with:
		taskLab, 0 clicks and 0.0 seconds)
F- changed MYO profile (personal->default) until the end of test
G- myo lost -> re-sync (bye bye angle)
H- Invalid line because of tester's delay in starting the timer

OTHER:
userID=1 --- angle was not well calibrated.
userID=10 --- phone test recorded after userID=11
In general, preset selection is the most difficult action to perform and the task number 1 is usually the hardest.
