bulky\, would use it at home;
From head of sales and marketing at oticon. very nice\, very interesting.
Futuristic project.;
great demo - would be interesting to see how this can be scaled down/made
more discreet;
;
some older users may have difficulty using this device but if after
calibration the gestures could be more discrete there could be great
potential in a device like this if it was scaled down into a commercial
watch such as apple---;
Ignore scores for this one. Just tom writing some verbal feed back
from users. great idea\, looks alot faster to use\, older people might
have some difficulties with some of the actions\, how do we give feedback
to the user? could the device be reduced in size? if it was built into
applewatch ths would have some good potential. nice that it is quicker
to use controls. (subjective: average feedback positive but sceptical
of device);
tom comments from users mark two. want to know about future perspectives
and application for elderly;
